# Autonomous Car Project
This is the source code for a path-following autonomous car. It's written in **C++** and implements a **PID** controller to follow a black-line path. The **Embedded System** utilizes 8 Infrared LEDs and Phototransitors to detect how well the car is following the path using **Sensor Fusion**. The repository contains several utility files for reading from the sensors and retrieving the encoder count. The main source code is in: `AutonomousCar.cpp`. The track the car had to navigate is shown in `AutonomousCarTrack.pdf`.
